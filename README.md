In the eighth episode of the second season of The Big Bang Theory, Raj and Sheldon decide to settle an argument by playing "rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock", which is like the original "rock-paper-scissors", but the addition of two new symbols decreases the chances of the result being a tie. This program simulates a match of the game in question.

The rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock are:

Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock crushes (or melts) scissors
Scissors decapitates lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper refutes Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
Rock crushes scissors
